# Pyxis

## Key Concepts

Pyxis is a MVVM framework based around JSX and function style components. When a
component is first being mounted, it receives a props object from which a view
model is constructed. This is in turn used to render descendant components.

This only happens once in a component's lifetime. Subsequent updates to the
rendered content are only possible via reactions to changes in the component's
observable state. With these constraints, Pyxis is able to build an efficient
dependency graph and only dispatch updates to areas that require a change.

### Atom

The building block of any observable state is an Atom. It is a thin wrapper
around any arbitrary value that can be changed at any time. Atoms don't expose
their value directly, instead it is necessary to use the `read`, `write` and
`update` functions to do so.

#### Read

The read function checks whether its input is an Atom and reads its value.
Non-atom inputs are returned as-is.

It also reports read access when used within a reaction or derivation block.

```ts
const count = atom(0);

read(count); // returns 0
read(123); // returns 123
```

#### Write

The write function checks whether its input is an Atom and writes its value. The
new value of the Atom is returned. Note that attempting to write readonly atoms
will quietly fail and their current, unchanged value will be returned. For
non-atom inputs this function is a no-op and returns the input as-is.

```ts
const count = atom(0);
const count2 = derivation(() => read(count) * 2); // readonly atom

write(count, 1); // writes count, returns 1
write(count2, 1); // does nothing, returns 2
write(123, 1); // does nothing, returns 123
```

#### Update

The update function works similarly to write, except it instead uses a transform
function to update the atom's value derived from its current one. Like write,
the new value of the atom is returned. For non-atom inputs, this function is a
no-op and returns the input as-is.

Update does *not* report read access, even when used within a reaction or
derivation block.

```ts
const count = atom(0);
const count2 = derivation(() => read(count) * 2); // readonly atom

const increment = (current: number) => current + 1;

update(count, increment); // increments count, returns 1
update(count2, increment); // does nothing, returns 2
update(123, increment); // does nothing, returns 123
```

### Derivation

Derivations are a special, readonly type of an atom. Their value is derived from
one or more other atoms. Derivations are updated when one or more of the atoms
they depend on change. The update is lazy and doesn't run until the derivation's
value is accessed.

```ts
const totalPrice = derivation(() => read(unitPrice) * read(quantity));
```

### Reaction

Reaction is a block of code that automatically re-runs whenever one or more
atoms it depends on change. Reaction blocks are synchronously executed upon
declaration and then eagerly re-run with updates.

```ts
reaction(() => {
  console.log("counter is", read(counter));
});
```

Reactions may also return a teardown function to dispose of any resources
allocated in its previous run.

### Mount and Unmount

Components may declare blocks of code to run once fully mounted, or once they're
about to be unmounted.

```ts
mounted(() => console.log("mounted"));
unmounted(() => console.log("unmounted"));

// combined form
mounted(() => {
  console.log("mounted");
  return () => console.log("unmounted");
});
```

### Contexts

To propagate contextual data from ancestors to descendants without "prop
drilling," contexts can be used. This is especially useful when descendants need
a contextual value while nested in other components oblivious to it. Using
contexts avoids polluting the intermediate components with data they don't need.

```ts
const CounterContext = createContext<number>();
```

With the context object ready, it can now be used in components. By requesting
mutable access to a context, the enclosing component automatically becomes a
provider of that context. All children and their descendants rendered by the
enclosing component will gain access to this data. A single component can be a
provider of multiple contexts.

```ts
// request a mutable (provider) atom for the given context
const counter = context.mutable(CounterContext, 0);

// freely write the context atom as needed
write(counter, 1);
```

Accessing contextual data is done very similarly, only omitting the `mutable`
modifier and the initial value. This returns a read-only Atom that can be used
in the view model like any other atom.

```ts
// get a read-only (consumer) atom for the given context
const counter = context(CounterContext);
```

### Rendering Text

Pyxis is a platform agnostic framework and uses external adapters to enable
rendering within a particular environment. As such it doesn't know how to render
text. Typically adapter libraries will provide their own `<Text>` component
which handles reactive text rendering.

```jsx
<Text>counter is {counter}</Text>
```

### Rendering Conditionally

Because Pyxis doesn't re-run component code, conditionally showing or hiding
content using patterns common in frameworks like React won't work as expected.

```tsx
return (
  <>
    {read(counter) < 10 ? null : (
      <Text>That's too many!</Text>
    )}
  </>
);
```

While the above code works and will correctly render when first mounted, it
won't react to changes of the counter, even if it is an atom. Instead, to render
reactive conditional content, a builtin `<Show>` component is used.

```tsx
return (
  <Show when={derived(() => read(counter) >= 10)}>
    {() => (
      <Text>That's too many!</Text>
    )}
  </Show>
);
```

The above example will dynamically show and hide the line of text depending on
the value of the counter atom.

### Rendering Lists

Because Pyxis doesn't re-run component code, rendering lists using patterns
common in frameworks like React won't work as expected.

```tsx
const items = [ "foo", "bar" ];
return (
  <ul>
    {items.map(it => (
      <li>
        <Text>{it}</Text>
      </li>
    ))}
  </ul>
);
```

While the above code works and will correctly render each item of the source
array, such a list will remain static and won't react to any changes of the
array. To get reactive lists, a builtin observable list is provided with a
matching `<Iterator>` component.

```tsx
const items = list([ "foo", "bar" ]);
return (
  <ul>
    <Iterator source={items}>
      {it => (
        <li>
          <Text>{it}</Text>
        </li>
      )}
    </Iterator>
  </ul>
);
```

Now, changes can be made to the items list via its own methods and the rendered
list will update as expected. This system helps Pyxis do fine grained updates
even on lists without diffing or reliance on unique keys to distinguish
individual items.

### Extensions

Pyxis supports extensions which add custom namespaced props to native elements
adding new behaviors in a streamlined way. For example the DOM adapter offers
the `ClassListExtension` allowing CSS classes to be set via the ClassList API
instead of the cumbersome method of concatenating all classes to a string and
setting the class prop.

```ts
// add extensions when building the Pyxis renderer
const renderer = pyxis(DomAdapter)
  .extend("cl", ClassListExtension) // "cl" will be the extension's namespace
  .build();

// when using extensions and TypeScript, it is necessary to declare JSX types
// manually instead of the defaults provided by adapters
declare global {
  namespace JSX {
    type Element = JsxResult;
    type IntrinsicElements = ElementsOf<typeof renderer>;
  }
}
```

After the renderer and types are set up, any native element can use extensions:

```tsx
interface CheckBoxProps {
  checked: Atom<boolean>;
}

const CheckBox = component((props: CheckBoxProps) => (
  <input
    type="checkbox"
    checked={props.checked}
    cl:checkbox // the "checkbox" class, always present
    cl:checked={props.checked} // the "checked" class, toggled by props.checked
  />
));
```
